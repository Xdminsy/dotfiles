### Ascension kits

### Cloak

## Be extremely careful after taking off comr.
## You are vunerable to polytrap or touch of death or wand of death.
## Likely happens after switching to a mummy wrapping to enter a store.
##
## Generally the most reliable way offering magic resistance in my mind.
## Magicbane may be disarmed by a bullwhip in hands of a horned devil.
##   And in Gehennom there may be a lot monsters around you except horned devil.
##   Then you are extremely vunerable to touch of death.
## Your quest artifact may be stolen by Rodney, then casting touch of death.
## Still be careful to foocubi may be summoned nasties and take off your cloak.

## The only permenanent source of very fast speed.

## The only option for wizard in my view, Elbereth everywhere and casting spells.
## And a great source of magic resistance for neutral players to sacrifice for.
## Before getting magic missile and the Eye of Aethiopica I'd train daggers if I'm not racketing.
## If unwielding magicbane be sure to have other MR item.
## Say you may wield a potion of paralyze or cockatrice corpse at some point.
## But for wizard who have their starting comr and no need to wear a robe.
MENUCOLOR="Magicbane"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="Magicbane \(weapon in hand\)|Magicbane \(wielded"=bright magenta&underline

## Less favorite

## I don't play lawful oftenly, but still a great weapon with an easy obtaining method.
## Also, in 3.7 the Valkyrie start with a spear instead of a long sword.
## You'd like other lawful roles to find a long sword first.
## I usually train daggers and the saber-skilled scimitars.

### Rings

## In 3.7 rings may be destroyed by shocking sphere.
## But wearing rings can be protected by non-iron gloves.
## And thanks to the amulet of flying, I hardly keep rings of levitation.

## The only source of free action.
## Though in 3.7 the orange dragon scale mail provide free action too.
MENUCOLOR="(ring of free action|ring called free)"=bright magenta

## It may likely wrest when 0:0 if you are unlucky.
MENUCOLOR="(wand of wishing|called wish)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(wand of death|called death)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
## Source of many ascensions kits. Should wish one if lack a lot.
## The amulet and rings and shirt are easy to polypile.
## And poly horns to get bag of holding or magic markers.
MENUCOLOR="(wand of polymorph|wand called poly)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
## Extremely useful in avoiding combat in end game or an escape way in early game.
MENUCOLOR="(wand of teleportation|wand called tp|wand called teleportation)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
## Sleep is quite useful to kill a lot nasty monsters who have no sleep resistance.
## For example Monk quest nemesis, minotaurs or some dragons.
## And the wand of sleep do not respect magic resistance, made it more useful than sleep spell.
## This also applies to you, if you have only MR but not reflection, you should obtain sleep resistance assp.
## You can eat elf zombies or elf mummies, eaten immediately, they have 40% chance of causing food poisoning.
## You can apply unicorn horn, quaff holy water, or one kind of potion of healing.
## Or eating a non-cursed eucalyptus leaf.
MENUCOLOR="(wand of sleep|wand called sleep)( named .*)?"=bright magenta

### Tools

## Invocation items
## You may throw them right after the invocation.
## Having little use while weighing 40, and cannot put into your bag of holding.
## But you can still carry them too, cause wizard of yendor may steal them instead
##   of your quest artifact or amulet of yendor.

## You may wish for EotA or PYEC if neutral.
## But EotA is only useful for roles who cast spells very very often.
## And the real power need you to have certain useful spellbooks.
## And for MR EotA provided requires you to wear it.
## Made you no slot for amulet of flying, reflection or life saving.
## The branchport may not be that useful.
## So be sure if you really need the only main feature it provides, the faster energy regen.
## Not worth an early wish, you may wish in castle if you really need it.
MENUCOLOR="Eye of the Aethiopica"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="Eye of the Aethiopica \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline
## For neutral, you can always wish PYEC instead of one dragon scale mail as an early wish.
## As you often can reach about -10 AC after reaching minetown, the power of PYEC is much greater than
## The MR protect you from death ray, and annoying polytraps or teleporters.
## The charging is incredibly useful for every roles, every role use wands the same.
## Comparing to spellcasting which really need some innate talents.
## Though roles except tourist can only charge like uncursed scroll of charging.
## But every wand you can charge 7 times, and you can charge infinitely most tools.
## And you can charge markers, the blessed charging won't do more good than uncursed in charging markers.
## You only need to use blessed charging for wishing, or if you have spare scrolls, death and polymorph are the later options.
## With PYEC you can cast an attacking wand dozens of times.
## You can polypile with one /oPoly dozens of times without need to polypiling or writing many scrolls of charging.
## But remember, PYEC has a cooldown, so in astral plane, be sure to have some scrolls of charging if you want to charge many wands.
MENUCOLOR="Platinum Yendorian Express Card"=bright magenta&underline
## Maybe best artifact wish for chaotic players.
## You gain teleport control and half physical damage, both are very very useful.
## The warning is acceptable, you can detect monsters which can be seen through telepathy.
## MKoT doesn't occupy any slot, you just carry it, better than ring of teleport control.
## You can wearing free action and conflict/levitation, and meanwhile have teleport control with master key.
## But remember, MR and reflection is more important.
## If it's an early wish, you need first obtain a source of MR or reflection.
## You can deal with most of the tourble cases with your careful operations.
## But the random death ray, oops, you can only prevent which by having reflection or MR assp.
MENUCOLOR="Master Key of Thievery"=bright magenta&underline
## The Orb of Fate is so heavy, but the half damage is awesome.
## The levelport, requires you to have teleport control, or else not so useful.
## You can still wish one if neutral.
## But, oftentimes, as you AC reach -30, your damage is much more important.
## So I'd prefer Grayswandir, and Grayswandir don't require your alignment, though requrie you saber skill.
MENUCOLOR="The Orb of Fate"=bright magenta&underline

## As an early wish, better wish one source of reflection or magic resistance.
## If you have one of which, you are immune to the death ray.
## In 3.7 purple L only spawns in Gehennom so MR is not so emergent.
## You can wish one great artifact like PYEC, EOTA, OOF or MKOT, or my favorite Grayswandir!
## Or a wand of polymorph to polypiling and gain everything.
