### Cloak

## Be extremely careful after taking off comr.
## You are vunerable to polytrap or touch of death or wand of death.
## Likely happens after switching to a mummy wrapping to enter a store.
##
## Generally the most reliable way offering magic resistance in my mind.
## Magicbane may be disarmed by a bullwhip in hands of a horned devil.
##   And in Gehennom there may be a lot monsters around you except horned devil.
##   Then you are extremely vunerable to touch of death.
## Your quest artifact may be stolen by Rodney, then casting touch of death.
## Still be careful to foocubi may be summoned nasties and take off your cloak.
MENUCOLOR="(cloak of magic resistance|called comr)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(cloak of magic resistance|called comr).*\(being worn"=bright blue&underline

## Often wear a small time when casting spells, if you play a melee role.
## Or I may wearing this for magic mapping gehennom.
## But I'd switch back to comr when and after killing Rodney.
MENUCOLOR="(robe)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(robe).*\(being worn\)"=bright blue&underline

## Maybe useful if you lack ranged attacks but have powerful enough melee attacks.

## Favorite amulet is flying, once find, wear to the end!

## Body armor

## Because the amulet slot is for flying.
## I typically only use silver dragon scale mail in 3.7
## And preserve the option that switch amulet to life saving in astral plane.
## But in 3.6 there's no flying and the gehennom has much less lava.
## You can choose gdsm + "ofReflection
# MENUCOLOR="(silver dragon scale mail)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(dragon scale mail)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(dragon scale mail)( named .*)? \(being worn"=bright blue&underline

## If you are roles who choose a reflection shield.
## Or if you like rings of levitation and relfection.
## And a great early wish if you afraid sdsm may degrade due to polytrap.
MENUCOLOR="(gray dragon scale mail)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(gray dragon scale mail)( named .*)? \(being worn"=bright blue&underline

## |EvilHack|
## In Evilhack and some other variants, there're no longer dragon scale mail.
## Instead that we merge dragon scales into existed armor.
## So typically one may choose mithril plate mail, crystal plate mail,
##   dragonhide studded armor, dark elven tunic, mithril dwarven chain mail, etc.
## And then merge dragon scales onto them.
MENUCOLOR="(\-scaled)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(\-scaled).* \(being worn"=bright blue&underline

## |EvilHack|
## The best artifact torso armor in EvilHack.
## Created by forging The Sword of Annihilation and Ashmar together.
## But, SoA seems better to disintergrate enemies.
## It's really hard to kill tough monster with -40 AC.
## And AoR cannot be dragon-scaled, so MR and Reflection cannot be provided this slot.
MENUCOLOR="(Armor of Retribution)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(Armor of Retribution)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright blue&underline


### Boots

## The only permenanent source of very fast speed.
## You get an extra turn most of the time.
## And the only source of intrinsic speed in 3.7 is a quantum mechanic.
## But it is likely to lose if encountering shades and skeletons afterwards.
MENUCOLOR="(speed boots)"=bright blue
MENUCOLOR="(speed boots)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright blue&underline

## You may switch to jumping boots in sanctum or astral plane to jump.

## The charging is incredibly useful for every roles, every role use wands the same.
## Comparing to spellcasting which really need some innate talents.
## Though roles except tourist can only charge like uncursed scroll of charging.
## But every wand you can charge 7 times, and you can charge infinitely most tools.
## And you can charge markers, the blessed charging won't do more good than uncursed in charging markers.
## You only need to use blessed charging for wishing, or if you have spare scrolls, death and polymorph are the later options.
## With PYEC you can cast an attacking wand dozens of times.
## You can polypile with one /oPoly dozens of times without need to polypiling or writing many scrolls of charging.

## You can wearing free action and conflict/levitation, and meanwhile have teleport control with master key.
## But remember, MR and reflection is more important.
## If it's an early wish, you need first obtain a source of MR or reflection.
