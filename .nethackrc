### Ascension kits

### Cloak

## Be extremely careful after taking off comr.
## You are vunerable to polytrap or touch of death or wand of death.
## Likely happens after switching to a mummy wrapping to enter a store.
##
## Generally the most reliable way offering magic resistance in my mind.
## Magicbane may be disarmed by a bullwhip in hands of a horned devil.
##   And in Gehennom there may be a lot monsters around you except horned devil.
##   Then you are extremely vunerable to touch of death.
## Your quest artifact may be stolen by Rodney, then casting touch of death.
## Still be careful to foocubi may be summoned nasties and take off your cloak.
# MENUCOLOR="(cloak of magic resistance|called comr)"=red
MENUCOLOR="(cloak of magic resistance|called comr)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## Often wear a small time when casting spells, if you play a melee role.
## Or I may wearing this for magic mapping gehennom.
## But I'd switch back to comr when and after killing Rodney.
MENUCOLOR="(robe)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## Maybe useful if you lack ranged attacks and powerful enough melle attacks.
## Not such useful, hardly lose expierence level when MC1.
## It's acceptable, but the comr or robe is more preferable.
## Say you could often stably cast magic missile with a robe.
MENUCOLOR="(cloak of protection)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## Favorite amulet is flying, once find, wear to the end!
## You may switch to "oLS once land on the Astral plane.
## Though it is a vanilla 3.7 or variants only amulet.
MENUCOLOR="(amulet of flying)( named .*)?"=bright magenta

MENUCOLOR="(amulet of life saving)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline
## Always wishing the sokoban give reflection.

MENUCOLOR="(dragon scale mail)"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(dragon scale mail)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

# MENUCOLOR="(gray dragon scale mail)"=red
MENUCOLOR="(gray dragon scale mail)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## The only permenanent source of very fast speed.
## You get an extra turn most of the time.
## And the only source of intrinsic speed in 3.7 is a quantum mechanic.
## But it is likely to lose if encountering shades and skeletons afterwards.
# MENUCOLOR="(speed boots)"=red
MENUCOLOR="(speed boots)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## You may switch to jumping boots in sanctum or astral plane to jump.
## And quaff blessed potions of speed or cast haste self to provide the very fast speed.
MENUCOLOR="(jumping boots|named jump)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## Shirt! There are plentiful shirt if polyjunk, so only enchanted are highlit.

MENUCOLOR="(\+[1-9].*shirt)( named .*)?.*\(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

## Shield of reflection are great for roles neither cast spells nor two-weapon.
## Or if you unfortunately got a boh instead from sokoban.
## Looking for a shield of reflection in medusa's island
## Or else you may very likely face death ray in the castle.
MENUCOLOR="(shield of reflection|polished silver shield)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(shield of reflection|polished silver shield)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline


### Helms
## Be careful to every unknown magical helms, you may lose protections.

MENUCOLOR="(helm of brilliance|called brilliance|called hob)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(helm of brilliance|called brilliance|called hob)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline
## Betray on astral plane to ascend simpler lol.

MENUCOLOR="(helm of telepathy|called tele|called hot)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline

MENUCOLOR="\+[1-9].*(leather gloves|called leather)( named .*)? \(being worn\)"=bright magenta&underline


### Weapons

## My favorite weapons, Grayswandir + silver saber!
## Sometimes wish for Grayswandir for it's excellent power.
## All fears comes from lack of firepower!
## I always wish one as long as I can train saber and already have reflection and MR.
# MENUCOLOR="Grayswandir"=red
MENUCOLOR="Grayswandir \(weapon in hand\)|Grayswandir \(wielded"=bright magenta&underline
MENUCOLOR="silver saber( named .*)? \(weapon in hand\)|silver saber( named .*)? \(wielded"=bright magenta&underline

## I don't play lawful oftenly, but still a great weapon with an easy obtaining method.
## Also, in 3.7 the Valkyrie start with a spear instead of a long sword.
## You'd like other lawful roles to find a long sword first.
## I usually train daggers and the saber-skilled scimitars.
# MENUCOLOR="Excalibur"=red
MENUCOLOR="Excalibur \(weapon in hand\)|Excalibur \(wielded"=bright magenta&underline

## The only option for wizard in my view, Elbereth everywhere and casting spells.
## And a great source of magic resistance for neutral players to sacrifice for.
## Before getting magic missile and the Eye of Aethiopica I'd train daggers if I'm not racketing.
## If unwielding magicbane be sure to have other MR item.
## Say you may wield a potion of paralyze or cockatrice corpse at some point.
## But for wizard who have their starting comr and no need to wear a robe.
## And the Eye provides MR too, so I always have 3 sources of MR lol.
# MENUCOLOR="Magicbane"=red
MENUCOLOR="Magicbane \(weapon in hand\)|Magicbane \(wielded"=bright magenta&underline


### Rings

## In 3.7 rings may be destroyed by shocking sphere.
## But wearing rings can be protected by non-iron gloves.
## And thanks to the amulet of flying, I hardly keep rings of levitation.

## The only source of free action.
## Though in 3.7 the orange dragon scale mail provide free action too.
MENUCOLOR="(ring of free action|ring called free)"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(ring of free action|ring called free)( named .*)? \(on.*\)"=bright magenta&underline

MENUCOLOR="(wand of wishing|called wish)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
MENUCOLOR="(wand of death|called death)( named .*)?"=bright magenta
## Source of many ascensions kits. Should wish one if lack a lot.
